  "aboutpara1": "In the Ethereum ecosystem, everyone is constantly talking about onboarding for the masses, but at conferences, it's always the same faces: the marketing officer of that project, the lead developer of another project, the head ambassador of yet another project. All these individuals are obviously already onboarded, and as meaningful and interesting as their experiences may be to share, a conference filled only with them risks turning into an echo chamber where everyone is just echoing each other.",
  "aboutpara1mobile": "In Ethereum discussions, the focus on mass onboarding is common, but conferences often echo the same voices – already onboarded figures like marketing officers and lead developers. This repetition poses a risk of creating an echo chamber.",
