            Diverse Events for a Diverse Community - Unlocking the Potential of Uncharted Perspectives

            In the Ethereum ecosystem, everyone is constantly talking about onboarding for the masses, but at conferences, it's always the same faces: the marketing officer of that project, the lead developer of another project, the head ambassador of yet another project. All these individuals are obviously already onboarded, and as meaningful and interesting as their experiences may be to share, a conference filled only with them risks turning into an echo chamber where everyone is just echoing each other.
            </p>

            <p className=" text-[#606060] Medium text-3xl text-center leading-normal mt-10 w-5/12">
            We believe that this loop can't be broken without offering a real incentive for those not yet familiar with web3 to participate in significant events.

            In short, the issue we aim to address is to bring actually new faces into the Ethereum ecosystem. We are convinced that this can only be achieved by creating events that are both accessible and high-profile. If you think the same, NapulEth Open Village is waiting for you...
